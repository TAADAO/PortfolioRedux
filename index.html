                        Welcome to my page! My name is Robert Omohundro, and I am from Lubbock, Texas.
                        I have lived in Lawrence, KS for the last 10 years. I have been married to my wife Aimee for
                        the last 10 years, and we have two kids, two cats, and two dogs.
                    </div><br>
                    <div class="para2">
                        I grew up in Lubbock, Texas for the vast beginning part of my life, and graduated from both high school
                        as well as Texas Tech University, double-majoring in both Business Management and Political Science. After graduating, 
                        I made my way up here with my wife, and have lived here ever since. After about 10 years in various jobs in sales and management, 
                        I decided I wanted to have more of a challenge in my life as well as the ability to be independent in my work, which 
                        is why I have decided to pursue full-stack web development and other methods of coding.

                        I am very proud to see the work I have been doing and the fact that each work represents growth in my abilities! I have
                        learned that in this type of environment, it takes a lot of grinding before you can shine!
